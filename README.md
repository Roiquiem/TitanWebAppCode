most of the files are just copies from here: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/web-apps-node-iot-hub-data-visualization.git

I worked based on this article: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-live-data-visualization-in-web-apps#host-the-web-app-in-app-service

and made my own changes in the ./public/js/ -files
